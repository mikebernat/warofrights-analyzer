<parameter name="CodeContent"># Smart Regiment Matcher (Fuzzy Matching)

## Overview

The Smart Regiment Matcher is an intelligent tool that automatically finds similar regiment names and suggests merges. It uses fuzzy string matching algorithms to identify small regiments that are likely variations or typos of larger regiments.

## Purpose

**Problem:** Players often have slight variations in their regiment tags:
- `8thCT`, `8THCT`, `8thct` (case variations)
- `1stMD`, `1STMD`, `1stMD.CAV` (formatting differences)
- `65thIL`, `65th-IL`, `65th IL` (spacing/punctuation)

**Solution:** Automatically detect these variations and suggest merging them into the most popular version.

## How It Works

### 1. **Analysis Phase**

The tool analyzes your data in several steps:

1. **Identify Small Regiments**
   - Sorts all regiments by player count
   - Focuses on bottom 50% (regiments with fewer players)
   - Skips single-player regiments (likely one-offs)

2. **Find Similar Names**
   - Uses fuzzy string matching (Levenshtein distance)
   - Compares small regiments against larger ones
   - Calculates similarity score (0-100%)

3. **Apply Filters**
   - Similarity threshold (default 75%)
   - Minimum player difference (default 5 players)
   - Target must be significantly larger

4. **Generate Suggestions**
   - Lists all potential matches
   - Shows affected players
   - Allows individual review and approval

### 2. **Review Phase**

You review each suggestion:
- See source regiment (small) → target regiment (large)
- View similarity percentage
- Expand to see all affected players
- Approve or skip each match

### 3. **Apply Phase**

Apply approved changes:
- All approved merges are applied at once
- Players are reassigned to target regiments
- All respawns are updated
- Changes are saved to localStorage

## Using the Tool

### Step 1: Open the Matcher

1. Go to **Regiment Reassignment** section
2. Click **"Smart Regiment Matcher"** button
3. Dialog opens with settings

### Step 2: Configure Settings

**Similarity Threshold** (50% - 95%)
- Higher = stricter matching
- Lower = more suggestions (may include false positives)
- Default: 75% (recommended)

**Examples:**
- 95%: Only near-identical names (e.g., `8thCT` vs `8THCT`)
- 75%: Similar names (e.g., `1stMD` vs `1STMD.CAV`)
- 50%: Loose matching (e.g., `65thIL` vs `6thIL`)

**Min Player Difference** (2 - 20)
- Target must have at least this many more players
- Prevents merging similarly-sized regiments
- Default: 5 players

**Examples:**
- 2: Merge if target has 2+ more players
- 5: Merge if target has 5+ more players (recommended)
- 10: Only merge into much larger regiments

### Step 3: Analyze

1. Click **"Analyze Regiments"**
2. Tool processes your data (takes 1-2 seconds)
3. Results appear as cards

### Step 4: Review Matches

Each match card shows:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ From: 8THCT              →  To: 8thCT               │
│ [3 players]         85% match    [52 players]       │
│                                                      │
│ [View 3 affected players ▼]                         │
│                                                      │
│                              [Approve Merge]         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**For each match:**
- Review the source and target regiments
- Check similarity percentage
- Expand to see affected players
- Click **"Approve Merge"** if correct

### Step 5: Apply Changes

1. Review all approved matches
2. Click **"Apply X Approved Changes"**
3. All approved merges are applied
4. Success message appears
5. Dialog closes

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Case Variations

**Data:**
- `8thCT` - 52 players
- `8THCT` - 3 players
- `8thct` - 2 players

**Result:**
- Suggests merging `8THCT` → `8thCT` (95% match)
- Suggests merging `8thct` → `8thCT` (95% match)
- Total: 5 players reassigned to `8thCT`

### Scenario 2: Company Suffixes

**Data:**
- `1stMD` - 45 players
- `1stMD.CAV` - 8 players
- `1STMD.Cav` - 3 players

**Result:**
- Suggests merging `1stMD.CAV` → `1stMD` (85% match)
- Suggests merging `1STMD.Cav` → `1stMD` (80% match)
- Total: 11 players reassigned to `1stMD`

### Scenario 3: Spacing/Punctuation

**Data:**
- `65thIL` - 38 players
- `65th-IL` - 5 players
- `65th IL` - 2 players

**Result:**
- Suggests merging `65th-IL` → `65thIL` (90% match)
- Suggests merging `65th IL` → `65thIL` (90% match)
- Total: 7 players reassigned to `65thIL`

## Algorithm Details

### Fuzzy Matching

Uses **Levenshtein Distance** algorithm:
- Calculates minimum edits to transform one string to another
- Edits: insertions, deletions, substitutions
- Converts distance to similarity score (0-1)

**Example:**
```
"8thCT" vs "8THCT"
- Normalize: "8thct" vs "8thct"
- Distance: 0 edits
- Similarity: 100%

"1stMD" vs "1stMD.CAV"
- Normalize: "1stmd" vs "1stmdcav"
- Distance: 3 edits (add "cav")
- Similarity: 1 - (3/8) = 62.5%
```

### Normalization

Before comparison:
1. Convert to lowercase
2. Remove non-alphanumeric characters
3. Calculate distance on normalized strings

**Examples:**
- `8thCT` → `8thct`
- `1stMD.CAV` → `1stmdcav`
- `65th-IL` → `65thil`

### Filtering Logic

A match is suggested if:
```javascript
similarity >= similarityThreshold &&
targetPlayerCount >= sourcePlayerCount + minPlayerDifference &&
sourceName !== targetName
```

**Example:**
- Source: `8THCT` (3 players)
- Target: `8thCT` (52 players)
- Similarity: 100%
- Player difference: 49
- ✅ Meets criteria (100% >= 75%, 49 >= 5)

- Improves chart readability
- More accurate statistics
- Cleaner exports

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Conservative

- Use default settings (75% threshold, 5 player difference)
- Review all suggestions carefully
- Approve only obvious matches
- Run multiple times with different settings

### 2. Review Before Applying

- Always expand and check affected players
- Verify similarity makes sense
- Look for false positives
- Skip questionable matches

### 3. Iterative Approach

**First Pass:**
- High threshold (85%)
- Catch obvious duplicates

**Second Pass:**
- Medium threshold (75%)
- Catch formatting variations

**Third Pass:**
- Lower threshold (65%)
- Catch edge cases

### 4. Manual Cleanup

- Use Smart Matcher for bulk work
- Handle edge cases manually
- Verify results in charts/tables
- Document any special cases

## Limitations

### 1. False Positives

**Issue:** Similar names that are actually different regiments

**Example:**
- `6thIL` vs `16thIL` (different regiments)
- `1stMD` vs `1stMA` (different states)

**Solution:**
- Review each suggestion
- Don't approve questionable matches
- Adjust similarity threshold

### 2. Ambiguous Cases

**Issue:** Multiple potential targets

**Example:**
- `8CT` could match `8thCT` or `8thCT.CAV`

**Solution:**
- Tool picks best match (highest similarity + most players)
- Review and adjust if needed

### 3. Context Required

**Issue:** Tool doesn't understand context

**Example:**
- `CB[30thOH]` should be `CB`, not `30thOH`
- Requires manual reassignment

**Solution:**
- Use Smart Matcher for obvious cases
- Handle complex patterns manually

- Check if manual cleanup needed

### Too Many Matches

**Possible Causes:**
- Threshold too low
- Many similar regiment names
- Lots of small regiments

**Solutions:**
- Raise similarity threshold
- Increase min player difference
- Review more carefully

### Incorrect Suggestions

**Possible Causes:**
- Algorithm limitations
- Ambiguous names
- Different regiments with similar names

**Solutions:**
- Don't approve questionable matches
- Adjust settings
- Use manual reassignment for edge cases
